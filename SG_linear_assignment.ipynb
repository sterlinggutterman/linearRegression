        "**Q0.** Please answer the following questions in your own words.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What makes a model \"linear\"? \"Linear\" in what?\n",
        "  - A linear model takes one variable and uses it to predict another. If there is a direct correlation, the relationship is said to be linear.\n",
        "2. How do you interpret the coefficient for a dummy/one-hot-encoded variable? (This is a trick question, and the trick involves how you handle the intercept of the model.)\n",
        "  - One-hot-encoded variables are categorical variables that have been converted to numeric values for the sake of the model. In some models, one category of the new variable becomes the intercept, so the coefficient is interpreted in relation to that.\n",
        "3. Can linear regression be used for classification? Explain why, or why not.\n",
        "  - Classification is when a model predicts a categorical outcome, so liner regression could be used if the categorical variables are converted into dummy variables. The outcome is less reliable as there is often more variation in categorical variables and the conversion is not perfect.\n",
        "4. What are signs that your linear model is over-fitting?\n",
        "  - Over-fitting occurs when a model is too complex for the data it is explaining. A negative r^2 indicates severe over-fitting.\n",
        "5. Clearly explain multi-colinearity using the two-stage least squares technique.\n",
        "  - Multicolinearity occurs when more than one variable is correlated with another. When these varaibles are regressed on each other, they cancel out and can not accurately predict the correlation between them. The two-stage least squares tecnique is a way to determine what is the most likely correlation between the multiple-correlated variables. The method utilizes an instrumental variable that is can provide a different correlation to avoid the variable that is causing the multicolinierity.\n",
        "6. What are two ways to incorporate nonlinear relationships between your target/response/dependent/outcome variable $y$ and your features/control/response/independent variables $x$?\n",
        "  - Non-linear relationships are bound to appear in some way. Neural networks are non-linear representations of linear relationships. Trees also represent non-linear relationships by showing all possible outcomes of how data are related.\n",
        "7. What is the interpretation of the intercept? A slope coefficient for a variable? The coefficient for a dummy/one-hot-encoded variable?\n",
        "  - The intercept represents the predicted value of Y when X is 0. The slope coefficient is how Y changes in relation to X. For a dummy variable, the coefficient represents the reference category of the variable.\n",

Compare the coefficients in the regression to the table from part 1. What pattern do you see? What are the coefficients in a regression of a continuous variable on one categorical variable?\n",

Split the sample 80/20 into a training and a test set and run a regression including that kind of \"property type X neighborhood\" dummy, plus `Review Scores Rating`. How does the slope coefficient for `Review Scores Rating`, the $R^2$, and the RMSE change? Do they increase significantly compares to part 5? Are the coefficients in this regression just the sum of the coefficients for `Neighbourhood ` and `Property Type` from 5? What is the most expensive kind of property you can rent?"

The coefficient on review scores rating changes with the addition of property type because different property types have different benefits and consequences which will influence consumer opinions. The r-squared increases from 0.067 to 0.075 meaning that the model with property type better explains the variation in the model. Thus, it indicates that room-type has more of an impact on price than neighbourhood. This assesment makes sense because while neighbourhoods can generally be considered 'nice' or 'average,' there is still variation within them.\n",
